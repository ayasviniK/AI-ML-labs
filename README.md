# 📘 AI & Machine Learning Practice Repository

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains practical implementations of core **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** concepts, combining **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on experience with the complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and saving reusable models.

Each task focuses on a different domain of AI to build a well-rounded understanding of modern ML techniques.
